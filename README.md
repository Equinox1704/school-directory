## üåê Deployment

* **GitHub Repo:** [https://github.com/your-username/school-directory](https://github.com/your-username/school-directory)
* **Live Site (Vercel):** [https://your-vercel-url.vercel.app](https://your-vercel-url.vercel.app)

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Ensure environment variables (`DB_HOST`, `DB_USER`, `DB_PASSWORD`, `DB_NAME`) are correctly set in Vercel for production.

## üì∏ Screenshots (Optional)

*Add screenshots of the Add School and Show Schools pages here for better presentation.*

## üóíÔ∏è Notes

* Images are stored in `/public/schoolImages`. For production scalability, consider using cloud storage (AWS S3, Cloudinary, or Supabase).
* Make sure the MySQL schema matches form fields. Example schema:

  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE schools (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    address TEXT NOT NULL,
    city VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    state VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    contact VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
    email_id VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    image_path VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
  );
  ```
